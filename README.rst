`Two-step verification <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-step_verification>`_ for Plone 4
with use of `Google Authenticator <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Authenticator>`_
app. This app allows users to enable the two-step verification for their Plone accounts.
A mobile device with Google Authenticator app installed is required. Usage of two-step
verification is optonal, unless site admins have forced it (configurable in app control
panel). Admins can white-list the IPs, for which the two-step verification would be
skipped.

Prerequiresites
================================================
- GoogleAuthenticator app installed on mobile device (official app available for
  Android, iPhone and Blackberry; third-party app exists for `Windows Phone
  <http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/authenticator/e7994dbc-2336-4950-91ba-ca22d653759b>`_).
- Plone 4 (tested with Plone >= 4.2.6)

Usage
================================================
Case 1: Enabling the two-step verification
------------------------------------------------
Pre-conditions: User is not logged into the Plone site, does not yet have two-step
verification enabled and has installed the Google Authenticator app (including the advised
bar code scanner) on his mobile device.

From any page follow the "Enable two-step verification" link in the menu (next to "Log out").

    :align: center

That will bring you to a page on which a bar code is shown.

.. image:: _static/02_two_step_verification_setup.png
    :align: center

You're supposed to scan the bar code shown on the page using the bar code scanner installed
on your mobile device, which you're going to use for verification.

After you have successfully scanned the bar code, enter the token shown in the "Enter the
verification code to activate two-step verification" field for confirmation and press the
"Verify" button.

Upon successful confirmation (you should see a message stating that) the two-step
verification is enabled for your account.

Case 2: Two-step verification
------------------------------------------------
Pre-conditions: User is not logged in and has enabled the two-step verification.

When you log into the Plone site (just using username and password), you would see an extra
screen on which you are asked to provide the token, generated by Google Authenticator.

.. image:: _static/04_login_token_form.png
    :align: center

You should then open the Google Authenticator app on your mobile device and type in the
token shown into the "Enter code" field.

If token is valid, you would be logged in.

Case 3: Lost tokens
------------------------------------------------
Pre-conditions: User is not logged in, has enabled the two-step verification.

There might be cases when you have lost your token (either removed it from your app by
accident or lost the mobile device). For such cases, you can reset the bar code.

Log into the Plone site (just using username and password), for to see the extra
screen on which you are asked to provide the token, generated by Google Authenticator
and follow the link (help text of the "Enter code" field). You would then land on the page
where from you can request the bar code reset.

    :align: center

Enter your username in the "Username" field, press the "Submit" button. Link for resetting
your bar code appear in your mailbox shortly. Having clicked on the link to reset the bar
code, would bring your to a page where you can scan the bar-code same way you have done it
when setting up the two-step verification.

.. image:: _static/06_reset_two_step_verification_bar_code.png
    :align: center

Scan the code with your mobile device and enter the code in the "Enter the verification
code to activate the two-step verification" field.

Upon successful confirmation (you should see a message stating that) your bar code is reset.

Installation
================================================
Buildout
------------------------------------------------
>>> [instance]
>>> eggs +=
>>>     collective.googleauthenticator

>>> zcml +=
>>>     collective.googleauthenticator

ZMI
------------------------------------------------
ZMI -> portal_quickinstaller
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Choose "Google Authenticator Plone" and install it.

ZMI -> acl_users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. Choose "google_auth (Google Authenticator plugin (collective.googleauthenticator))".

2. Make sure the "Active plugins" section of "Authentication" has the following plugins in
   the given order ("google_auth" should come as first - critical!):

    - google_auth
    - session
    - source_users

Configuration options
================================================
App control panel can be accessed at
http://your-plone-site.com/@@google-authenticator-settings

.. image:: _static/09_control_panel.png
    :align: center

Secret Key
------------------------------------------------
Site secret key - can be any string. See it as some sort of a password.

Globally enabled
------------------------------------------------
If checked, two-step verification is globally force-enabled for all site users and they no
longer have an option to disable it; this applies to all new users (just registered accounts)
as well.

White-listed IP addresses
------------------------------------------------
List of white-listed IP addresses - one at a line. If user comes from one of those,
the two-step verification is skipped even if user has enabled it or two-step verification
is globally enabled.

Extra
------------------------------------------------
Additionals options of the control panel are:

- Enable two-step verification for all users.
- Disable two-step verification for all users.

Notes
================================================
It's important that Google Authenticator comes as first in the ZMI -> acl_users -> Authentication.

Tested in combination with the following products:

- The `Products.LoginLockout <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Products.LoginLockout>`_.
  `GoogleAuthenticator` comes as first, `LoginLockout` as second. All works fine.

Implementation details
================================================
This package is beta. Comments and suggestions are welcome.

- Plone PAS plugin, which checks if user has the two-step verification enabled for
  user trying to log in. If so, redirect user to a separate page (a view), where the
  extra credentials (Google Authenticator token) is asked for.
- Google Authenticator token validation form view. If token is valid, definitely authenticates
  the user.
- Google Authenticator setup form view, where each user scans a bar code image is shown and
  fills in the token generated by his Google Authenticator app. Upon successful token
  validation, the two-step verification is enabled for the user.
- User record is extended with two fields:
      * `enable_two_factor_authentication` (bool): Indicates whether user has enabled the
        two-step verification for his profile.
      * `two_factor_authentication_secret` (str): Users' secret key to be used for generating
        the bar code image. Filled in automatically when user enables the two-step verification.
- Google Authenticator disable view, on which user can disable the two-step verification for
  his account.
- The Plone standard login form (skins/login_form.cpt) has been overridden (the `came_from`
  form field taken out).
  Still the "came from" functionality works still in the very same way as it was before, just
  slightly different - in a way that it works well with Google Authenticator too.
- The Plone standard "popupforms.js" has been overridden. The part of login forms being shown
  in an overlay has been taken out, due to the problems of Google Authenticator working with
  overlays. This issue might be solved in future versions of the app.

Documentation
================================================
See the documentation at:

- http://collectivegoogleauthenticator.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
- http://pythonhosted.org/collective.googleauthenticator/

Troubleshooting
================================================
If you're quick enough to enter the tokens generated by GoogleAuthenticator app before they
expire (remaining time is clearly indicated in the GoogleAuthenticator app) but still
get the "Invalid token or token expired" message, make sure your timezone settings on the
server are accurate.
