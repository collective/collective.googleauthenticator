TODOs/Roadmap
================================================
Based on the MoSCoW principle. Must haves and should haves are planned to be worked on.

* Features/issues marked with plus (+) are implemented/solved.
* Features/issues marked with minus (-) are yet to be implemented.

Must haves
------------------------------------------------
- Possibly to be able to set the GoogleAuthenticator required for certain users/groups
  to use the two-step verification.
- At the moment, Plone top login link (AJAX overlay) doesn't work with Google Authenticator. Default
  "popupforms.js" has been overridden by a custom one, where the part of login forms being shown in
  an overlay has been commented out. Make Google Authenticator working with overlays.
- Fallback code in GoogleAuthenticator setup and recover.
- Better documentation.
- Change everywhere to "Two-step verification".
